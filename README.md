# Sollars-Calculator
Created the calculator interface using a bootstrap modal, with flat design principles, but first mocked-up inVisionApp. The left hand tree and main body had to maintain property state no matter where the user input. All iterations had animations to guide the user in a pleasure experience. Like Facebook, I ran into some issues with data flow and accurate states. I may rebuild this with ReactJS purely on noble principles :)
